                    <h5>"You need to learn more about other nation by coming to them, the <span>real world</span> is wide, you know?"</h5>
                    <p>Eternal Celestia tells the story of Richi Artemovia Hikaru, a divine being descended from the highest realm of gods and goddesses to guide humanity and other races on the planet La Terra. As the 17th Key among the Klyviora, Richi is known as the Soul Judgementor, the Savior Key. He is sent to Arcarum, a serene and beautiful land, where he becomes part of the royal family and mentors the crown prince, Kiryuu Kazeyama Fabio.

                    Throughout his years of guidance, the Creator reveals a prophecy to the 17 Klyviora, warning them of a great danger—other creations of the divine—that threaten to destroy the world one by one. As Richi leads Kaze to unite nations and uncover their histories, one question lingers: What is Richi's true purpose? Only he knows.</p>
